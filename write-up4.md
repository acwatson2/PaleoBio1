###Summary
Zaffos and Miller write about marine bivalve `and gastropod` genera from the ~~Miocene to the Pleistocene~~ `Cenozoic`. More so, the paper looks at how the distribution of genera first occurs in the tropics and end in the extratropics `(what do you mean here exactly?)`. The authors suggest that a ~~the~~ potential explanation is “latitudinal distributions preferentially move in a poleward direction” `(this is actually a result that has emerged from previously analyses, as discussed in the introduction)`. To determine if this is true the authors suggest `that` a number of questions ~~that~~ need to be answered…`(the following are not framed/punctuated as questions!)` Is there latitudinal poleward movement, second is the center of distribution shifted or is it geographic range of a species `(what does this mean? center of range vs. range?)`. Third, how big are the shifts in population and do geologic events effect there movements and lastly, are there variations to the changes and how does time factor into the changes. To begin, Zaffos and Miller ~~parameterixe~~ a unimodal response curve and calculate the latitudinal tolerance and preferred latitude parameters for each taxon in each of the time intervals that span the Cenozoic. Further, the analytical methods used measure the “poleward vs. equatorward drift, and latitudinal tolerance expansion vs. contraction”.
> This summary is not particularly well articulated. It would be hard for somebody who has not read the paper to read this and understand what was measured and what the conclusions were.

###Positives
In all, this paper is easily among the easiest to understand that has been assigned. To begin, the intro breaks down the direction the paper is going to take with a well-defined list of questions. It never leaves the reader searching for more information and makes very few assumptions about the reader’s current knowledge of the subject matter. Earlier works by the author are quoted and explained relatively well, not leaving the reader to wonder or search for more material which usually makes a paper feel cumbersome and harder to understand. The analytics of the paper are laid out quite clearly, with most equations shown after the paragraph that describes the methods being used. Albeit, some of the maths might be foreign to many, with a bit of searching it’s not overly hard to understand. Lastly, the results and discussion sections where quite good and brought the paper as a whole back around to the beginning and made clear points and more or less conclusions. 
> I would like to see more specifics. What, specifically, about the "analytics" did you like? It is good to point out that you found the paper clearly articulated, but what about the underlying data, analysis, and interpretations?

###Negatives
The authors Zaffos and Miller, put together a paper, that could be condenced a bit to keep things a more fluid and clearer without getting lost in detail. While the paper as a whole is good the reader might get lost, as I did, in the analytical methods section. I found the maths a bit difficult to understand, as I haven’t really discussed much or put into practice these methods. Although with a bit of contemplation, the methods become almost clear, I was always left wondering if I was thinking of the methods correctly. 
> It is undestandable that some of the specific methods used were new and hard to understand. They usually require some amount of background knowledge to fully appreciated. It would be good to bring these types of questions up when the paper is discussed in class!

###Figures and Tables
The figures and graphs section of the paper are almost certainly necessary. Without them it would be quite difficult to picture some if not most of the results of the paper. 
> Again, a little more specific information would help. What do the figures illustrate that is necessary to the paper?
