Clues from the Californian Pleistocene by Valentine, is a study of Marine life off the cost of California, specifically the Californian Province. The author looks to answer questions about the completeness and of the fossil record using marine benthic Pleistocene Fauna. Valentine states that the need for understanding the fossil record and assessing its quality due to the “efforts of paleontologists that infer processes of ecology and evolution from the fossil data” has never been more important. Valentine states there are three ways for studying the benthics as a way to understand the fossil record and what evidence it gives about past life on earth. The first sort of study is the use of modern marine fauna, in an effort to understand the way potentially fossilizable skeletons end up in dead shell assemblages. More over, Valentine demonstrates how the dead assemblages closely reflect skeletonized species that live in the area and in some cases there is “ fine spatial gradients and variations in living associations mirrored in dead assemblages”. The second sort “involves the interpretation of assemblages and their mode of formation”. This is to better understand how species of all sorts end up in the fossil record and to understand the transport of a species to its resting place. In other words, determine how and where the species lived and what brought it there.  The third sort involves quantitative assessments of the completeness of the litho/biostratigraphic record giving an idea as to how often assemblages are incorporated into the record.  Materials and methods used in the study are then laid out, describing the locations of samples where taken from as well as dating them and why they were sampled.  From here comparrisons are made between living and dead fauna, and a discussion on the completeness of the fossil record and the implications it holds are given. The author does a good job at explaining where the fauna of study was taken and what species were excluded and why. The environments from where the samples came and methods of dating are explained well.  The reader is well assured that the benthic species studied where restrained to the Pleistocene, which makes it easy to identify species with living fauna of today. The comparison section is where I became most interested in this paper. The author show how some species in the fossil record are still alive today but have since moved to the North or South of the test site due to changes in the thermal gradient of the ocean. This is exciting evidence as to how the planet changes, evidence like this is what makes this part of the paper the more interesting to read.  Beyond this point the discussion section does a decent job at bringing everything together. Finally, the general Implications section is the best part of the paper. It brings everything together and makes some important claims that are very interesting. Such as, the fossil record contains or has captured all of the important species and species relations. The paper gives some interesting conclusions and all in all is written quite well but a few issues can be found. 	Like many scientific papers, you can’t just pick them up and read without pausing to think and understand what you just read.  This paper is more or less no different. It has the necessary information but seems to be somewhat passive in its approach. The author seems to state what it is he is trying to say plan and clear as day, but somehow it comes of as vague. The intro gives the three modes as to how the fossil record off the coast of California need be studied but the lead up to those methods was spare and left me having to reread as to why he is studying this area the way he did as well as its need. Beyond the intro the paper gave good evidence and became cleare, yet still left me wanting to find a better paper on the subject. 	The tables and figures were sparse, yet the information necessary, for the most part, was given. A cross section might have been useful to see where the species came from better or charts relating currents and species distributions might have made things clearer.
