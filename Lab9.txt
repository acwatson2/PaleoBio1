The lty is a line type that defines the borders.3) > AlbianMap<-downloadPaleogeography(Age=110)4) plot(AlbianMap,col=rgb(0,1,0,0.33),lty=0.01,add=TRUE)5) North and South6) East and West

Part 31) >DataPBDB<-downloadPBDB(Taxa=c("Perissodactyla"),StartInterval="Paleogene",StopInterval="Paleogene")2) The odd toe (odd toed ungulate) is a defining feature and zebras and rhionos are common examples.3) subset(DataPBDB,DataPBDB[,"collection_no"]==112723)4) 501 is the geo_plate id associated with this collection and is located in modern day Pakistan.

6) Region-x (paleo Pakistan) moved North from the Albanian to present day colliding with Asia around 80 million years ago and continues to move North today.  
7)It is most likely that Perissodactyla migrated from China to region-x as it appeared first in china around 58 million years ago. While they are of the same order, at the family and genus levels they differ, giving good evidence they came from a different location altogether but first appeared in China then India and Pakistan (region-x).
