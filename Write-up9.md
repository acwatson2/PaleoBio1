## Summary

The authors, Droser et al., in Decoupling of taxonomic and ecologic severity of Phanerozoic marine mass extinctions looks into the relationship between taxonomic and ecologic changes between mass extinctions. Specifically, what happens when an organism goes extinct or its population/diversity is severally diminished and what ecological importance they have in retaining ecological structure. The authors looked mainly at marine fauna, ranging from reefs to pelagic and benthic organisms. Further, the authors found that, although the extinction rate during the Ordovician was greater than that of the Devonian, key species such as stromatoporoids- where wiped out which severely affected the reef distribution of tabulate corals due to the symbiotic relationship these species shared. The authors used a rating system from one to four, decreasing in severity as far as the affects on ecology. The first level relates to the appearance/disappearance of an ecosystem and the second, which occurred in the Devonian, separating it from the Ordovician, relates to Structural changes within an ecosystem. Three is a community-type level changes within an established ecological structure and four is a community level change. The authors managed to give good evidence for the importance of taxa with high ecological value has.

The introduction to this paper is succinct and very easy to understand. The authors did an excellent job at explaining the issue at hand as well as explaining the approach they used to prove their point. The entire paper is extremely easy to understand and I found the discussion section to be greatly informative, answering most questions that arose during the reading. They separated the two main points into two sections, the Ordovician and Devonian, and explained what fauna went extinct or near extinct or bounced back to be prolific and giving the paleoecological level and characteristic for each level. This demonstrated perfectly, how certain taxa have greater effects on the ecology than others. In all, this paper was written very well and is by far my favorite for the semester because it was easy to read, not a lot of jargon, and it was broken up into easily digestible parts that flowed together perfectly. More papers like this please. 

## Dislikes

Not much to complain about with this paper. Figure one could have been put together a bit better but all in all there is nothing I have to say about this paper. It may be slightly short and could have given a bit more detail but in the end I probably wouldn√ït change anything. 

## Figures

There are only two figures in this paper and both display the necessary data for this paper, although figure one could have been a bit more detailed, they work perfectly fine.
