## Summary 
In The Influence of Lithification on Cenozoic Marine Biodiversity trends, author Austin J.W. Hendy investigates the differences of within-community diversity between Paleozoic and Cenozoic assemblages and if it is related to the availability of unlithified vs lithified sediments. Hendy’s study was constrained by a number factors to determine if the availability in unlithified sediments are the cause of an increase in biodiversity; geographic constraints in order to “avoid other  confounding factors such as depositional environment, latitudinal position, time averaging, and temporal averaging in biodiversity itself.  The samples used, mollusk-and brachiopod dominated fossils, originate from two sedimentary basins off the coast of New Zealand and range in age from the late Miocene to the Pleistocene. In the end, Hendy found that lithified assemblages did demonstrate the level of diversity as do unlithified sediments and that they were two to three times less, or more. Further, he suggest a number of causes as to why, ranging from minerology and robustness of skeletal hardparts that are destroyed during lithification to environmental factors and latitudinal distribution. Further, analysis incorporating sampling-standardization of genus occurrences suggests that diversity has not increased over the Phanerozoic to the Recent as other studies suggest. In the end the author suggests that as much as half of the increase in diversity is due to the availability of unlithified sediments. 

## Likes
Hendy’s article was constructed well, although the intro is a bit vague and bounces around ideas, his thesis is quite clear and states exactly what the study is about, what the information to come and the guidelines that he will follow. The methods section lays out the process in a way that is very easy to understand with references to the abundant figures and charts that help visualize the actual data and quantifies the differences. The results obtained from this study are mostly definitive and make sense, within the framework of the study, and mostly agree with other studies in diversity through geologic time. Although Hendy doesn’t use sample-standardization, he quotes a study by Sepkoski that does, which shows “no dramatic increase in diversity toward the recent” and <strike>states</strike> reaffirms his statement that the availability of unlithified sediments is the cause of the increase in diversity. This mostly addressed concerns of not using sample standardization. 

## Dislikes
The problems I have with this paper are mainly with how it is written and only one strong question was raised in my mind, why did the author not use sample-standardization in his research. It seems that the rock record itself is not complete and because of this, should be accounted for when looking into. Regardless of how much unlithified rock was available in the early Phanerozoic, what was should be scalable, and should be able to give data as to diversity change when compared to lithified and unlithfied samples from more recent sediments. As for the writing, the article at some points was not as concise as it could have been and felt as though I had to search harder thatn necessary for the message the author was trying to convey. 

> He did use sampling standardization - what he called classical analytic rarefaction is a form of sampling standardization.

> I find your idea of scaling diversty interesting. Scaling means you must assume a steady relationship between richness and unlithified sediments. I would say that Hendy's work is only the first step in proving and measuring such a relationship.

## Figures
The tables and figures were quite clear and conveyed the necessary information, making it easier to understand what the results were. The bar graphs were easy to read with differences in color and well defined axis and tables one and two could have been better, feeling a little cluttered. 

> Okay, I liked your write-up overall, but you should put more detail into these sections. Describe what the figures depict and why they are useful. This is very important.
