	1) > mean(sample(Lucina[,"paleolng"],length(Lucina[,"paleolng"]),replace=TRUE))
	   This is taking the mean of Lucina based on a random sample of paleo longitudes 	   dividing by the length of Lucina and allowing for repeated values. 
	2) > plot(density(ResampledMeans)) Yes, its Gaussian. It’s the mean of the mean,
	     with deviation equal to both sided of the curve.  
	3) > mean(ResampledMeans)
	   [1] 24.16227 which is almost identical to the original mean which is 24.1997.

	6) > Because they are the upper and lower bounds or values of the resampled    		     mean, giving them a range upper and lover, with a value in between.

	3) Based on the confidence number Dallarca should still be alive.  
	4) The confidence interval should not be trusted but the pure reading should be.
           The last recorded appearance of Dallarca was over 2.5 million years ago, it is               
           unlikely still alive or that it will be around millions of years from now. 
Part 4
	1) 
	2) The likelihood of erosion taking place whipping out ranges of stratigraphic 
	   units or reworking the fossils into earlier units would affect the
           distribution.

	   About 52 percent are extant today.
