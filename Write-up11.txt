## Summary 
	In The effect of geographic range on extinction risk during background and mask extinction, the Authors Payne and Finnegan explain that while Òprecise cause of extinction for most individual species is likely unknowableÓ, determining whether or not geographic range size is a predictor for extinction risk is knowable.  The authors posse that while geographic range size is Òthought to buffer taxa against extinctionÓ, it hasnÕt been studied over a wide range of time. The paper focuses on a time interval of 500 My spanning the Cambrian to the Neogene, in an attempt to determine Òwhether selectivity regimes differ between background and mass extinctions.  To do so the authors use logistic regression to evaluate the selectivity of genus survivorship in regards to geographic of benthic marine invertebrates using the Paleobiology Database (PBDB). The results show that geographic range size is significantly associated with survivorship over the time interval tested. 

 ## Likes
	Overall the layout of the paper is well thought out and executed and the introduction, abstract and conclusion being the most useful in understanding the paper. The methods section was broken into four sections, fossil occurrences, selectivity, logistic regression, and metrics of record quality. Here is where the steps taken to run the study, previously explained in earlier parts of the paper, made more sense to me. While I did find this paper a bit tedious to read the abstract did convincingly, along with the intro and conclusion, describe in detail how the final results where obtained. In the end I found myself assured that geographic range size was a determinant of extinction.
	
## Dislikes

Where to beginÉ My problem with this paper has nothing to do with the methods used or any of the calculated data and results. The authors make a convincing argument for geographic range as a significant predictor of extinction risk. Yet, it was the layout, wording and overall tone of the paper that made it extremely difficult to read and follows. A paper is only as good as the writing, no matter the evidence and subject matter. I found it very difficult to stay interested in this reading. The results section read more like the overall method and I found myself wondering what the actual outcome was of the research was.  The authors do seem to account for all necessary variables such as tectonic plates, global occurrences, species richness and use logistic regression, a binary,  to avoid spurious results bet then seem to drowned out the results in jargon and overly descriptive/wordy writing. I struggled with this paper.

## Charts and Figures

The charts and figures in the paper were adequate albeit slightly hard to read only due to there size on printed paper. In reality, they gave important information that made understanding the papers claims easier to understand.
